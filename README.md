# Cura FeatureFanSpeed Plugin

This is a Cura post processing script to set fan speed based on feature type for 3D printing.

This allows the fan speed to be set based on the feature - eg the inner or outer walls, the skin or infill. This allows cooling to be reduced on inner parts of a model where additional adhesion is needed while increasing the fan out the outer surfaces where a better surface finish is needed.

Additionally this allows a different fan speed on the first layer of the model. Increasing the cooling here can reduce adhesion to the build plate or a raft, making the model easier to remove.

# Installation

Simply place this script in the Cura `scripts` folder and restart Cura.
